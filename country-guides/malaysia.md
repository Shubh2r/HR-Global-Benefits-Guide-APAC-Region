If the employee is terminated due to serious misconduct (e.g., theft, fraud, insubordination), the employer is generally not required to provide notice or severance pay. However, the employer must:

Ensure that the termination is justified and legal.
In this case, the employer must still settle unpaid wages, unused annual leave, and any other benefits owed up to the termination date.
