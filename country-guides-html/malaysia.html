<h2>üßæ Summary of Benefits</h2>
<p><strong>Amount of annual leave required :</strong>: Annual Leave - 
Depends on length of service: Less than two years: 8 days per 12 calendar months; More than two years but less than five years: 12 days per 12 calendar months; More than five years: 16 days. Correct
Leave should be added on a pro-rata basis, or the full leave allocation be granted as per the original entitlement? Depend on the company can give entitlement 8 days a year or prorate each month.</p>
<p>Bereavement Leave - Could you please confirm if it is mandatory to provide bereavement leave as per the country law, if it is not, can we proceed as per our policy?
Also, can we ask for supporting document before approving the bereavement leave? We called as Compassionate leave. Companies are not required to provide compassionate or bereavement leave to employees ‚Äî but it is common practice for most companies to outline this provision in employment contracts as part of a mutual agreement between employers and employees. Even if compassionate leave is not mentioned in any documentation, employers may still choose to grant the leave if requested by the employee.</p>
<p>Leave encashment - Could you please confirm if it is mandatory to provide leave encashment in case of off-boarding or termination. 
A leave encashment policy is a set of rules created by employers. It explains how employees can get paid for their unused leave days, typically at the end of the year or when they leave the company due to termination, retirement, or resignation. Therefore, if employees resigned, they need to utilized the balance of leave entitled to them.</p>
<p><strong>Amount of sick leave :</strong>: Sick Leave - Length of service of less than 2 years: 14 days, More than 2 years but less than 5 years: 18 days, More than 5 years: 22 days. Correct Can we request a sick note or medical report to support the leave? Yes, employees need to give medical sick certificate from registered medical practitioners. *If hospitalization is necessary, the employee is entitled to an additional 60 days‚Äô leave. Sick leave entitlement should not be prorated if the employee joins or leaves the company during the year</p>
<p><strong>Terminations </strong>: Termination Due to Misconduct
If the employee is terminated due to serious misconduct (e.g., theft, fraud, insubordination), the employer is generally not required to provide notice or severance pay. However, the employer must:
Follow proper procedures for disciplinary action (e.g., giving the employee an opportunity to explain themselves).
Ensure that the termination is justified and legal.
In this case, the employer must still settle unpaid wages, unused annual leave, and any other benefits owed up to the termination date.</p>
